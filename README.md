## About

A console application with a simple user interface for managing and working with browser profiles with anti-detection protection. 

It is based on the [browser-with-fingerprints](https://github.com/CheshireCaat/browser-with-fingerprints) plugin, which allows you to change your browser fingerprint, create a virtual identity and increase the secrecy of your browser. 

This is done using the [FingerprintSwitcher](https://fingerprints.bablosoft.com/) service, which allows you to replace a list of important browser properties, so you will behave like a completely new user.
